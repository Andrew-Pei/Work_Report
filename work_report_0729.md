Weekly work report
==================

This week I am mainly engaged in the following tasks:

1.  I read the papers and the corresponding codes to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of various collection methods, time complexity, storage complexity, end-to-end training, and applicable occasions. The eigenpooling method is a method based on deep mathematics. While reading the paper, I learned a lot of graph theory to help understand. For related documents, please refer to 
    
2.  At the same time, in order to get a more concrete understanding of GNN, I looked at some papers on GNN's application scenarios. The application scenarios mainly include link prediction, node  classification, and graph classification.
    
3.  Regarding the calculation of complexity, although I have learned in the data structure and algorithm course, I always thought it was a very detailed matter. So every time I calculate, I will fall into the reading of the source code. Later, the zhizhou senior told me that the computational complexity does not need to look at the code, just need me to read the paper. At the same time, I read an article about CNN's complexity calculation, and then I have ideas, so I analyzed the complexity of various pooling methods. For related documents, please refer to 
    
4.  Miscellaneous: I learned about markdown and embedding the latex formula in markdown. These tips make my report presentation clearer and easier to understand.

Future Plan
-----------

The finishing work of the preliminary work. It includes some features of the pooling method.
