# weekly work report

This week, my main work is summarized in the following sections:

1. Learn Visio. Last Monday, Zhizhou assigned me a task of drawing, I needed to learn this software, so I quickly learned the basic operation of this software.

2. Successfully run the Pytorch-geometric library on the server.

3. Read the official document of Pytorch-geometric. Related reading notes are in the codes_notes folder.

### Future plan:

  Rewrite the Topk code and do the experiment, including the following parts:

1. Visualize the nodes that are reserved after pooling.

2. Compare SAGPooling with TopkPooling.

3. Increase the dimension of p.

4. Increase the threshold to adaptively determine the pooling ratio.

5. How to deal with the information of the eliminated nodes.
